# ACCBot

This bot was the product created from my final year project. Almost all the logic and decision for this bot was based around utility systems and the bot makes decisions on what to build based on the current state of the game (and the aggression value of the AI). The AI created managed to defeat the in game AI almost 100% of the time (all races) and managed to defeat human players aswell

## TO ADD

If I had more time on the project, I would have added better utility AI for the unit control and targeting and some personality when it came to desired build paths (maybe the AI prefered air units or bio units)

## Licence

This project was made with the use of some open source libraries BWAPI and BWTA2. The project works with the Starcraft broodwar game (Blizzard entertainment)
